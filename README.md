## Documentation and guides

[iOS Docs and guides](https://developer.kustomer.com/chat-sdk/v2-iOS/docs)

[Kustomer Developer Portal](https://developer.kustomer.com)

## Requirements

- A [Kustomer.com](https://www.kustomer.com/) API Key ([How to get an API key](https://developer.kustomer.com/chat-sdk/v2.0.4-iOS/docs/installation))
- Xcode 14.0+
- iOS 12.0+

## Installation

Note: Starting with iOS version 2.6.0, the PubNub library is downloaded as a dependency if installing the SDK using the Swift Package Manager or Cocoapods.

#### Swift Package Manager
1. Create or open your project inside of Xcode
2. Navigate to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency
3. Enter https://github.com/kustomer/kustomer-ios in the URL field
4. Use the Up to Next Major Version rule spanning from 2.0.0 < 3.0.0, and hit the Next button

#### Cocoapods
1. Add `pod 'KustomerChat', :git => 'https://github.com/kustomer/kustomer-ios.git'` to your Podfile
2. Run `pod update` or `pod install` on your project

#### Manual
1. Add `KustomerChat.xcframework` to your project's `Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content` section.
2. Check `Embed & Sign` for both frameworks.
3. Add PubNub using your preferred method. You can find details in their documentation [here](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/swift)

CALLOUT: If you add PubNub as a git submodule, you must install the PubNub version required by our podspec/package.swift.

#### Manual - Static version
The [release page](../../releases) for each version contains a static version of the SDK. To install, download and unzip `libKustomerChatStatic.xcframework` and `KustomerAssets.bundle`, and add them to your project. You will also need to install the version of PubNub required by our podspec/package.swift. You can find details in their documentation [here](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/sdks/swift)

## Post-Install
1. Add photo and camera privacy descriptions to your `Info.plist`.
2. In the `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method of your `AppDelegate` add
```
Kustomer.configure(apiKey: "API_KEY_HERE", options: nil, launchOptions: launchOptions)
```

3. Call `Kustomer.show()` whenever and wherever you want to open the Kustomer chat interface.

See [Installation](https://developer.kustomer.com/chat-sdk/v2.0.5-iOS/docs/installation) for a full guide.

## Example app

- Open `Example/Example.xcodeproj`
- Set your API key in `AppDelegate.swift`
  - Your API key must have *only* the `org.tracking` role. You can get your API key from the Kustomer website.
- Run the app
